# things to add
- use have each unit be an autoencoder of a certain size (like neuronal columns in the brain)
- have the input to each unit be the input of the autoencoder, and the output be the hidden weights
- add an objective arrow, to pick what the autoencoder wants to aim for (either itself, or someother input/output of some other unit)
- use WebGL for computing see [this](https://vimeo.com/97329154)
